    Can be used via the `throttle_task` decorator above.

    This implements the timestamp-based algorithm detailed here:

        https://www.figma.com/blog/an-alternative-approach-to-rate-limiting/

    Basically, you keep track of the number of requests and use the key
    expiration as a reset of the counter.

    So you have a rate of 5/m, and your first task comes in. You create a key:

        celery_throttle:task_name = 1
        celery_throttle:task_name.expires = 60

    Another task comes in a few seconds later:

        celery_throttle:task_name = 2
        Do not update the ttl, it now has 58s remaining

    And so forth, until:

        celery_throttle:task_name = 6
        (10s remaining)

    We're over the threshold. Re-queue the task for later. 10s later:

        Key expires b/c no more ttl.

    Another task comes in:

        celery_throttle:task_name = 1
        celery_throttle:task_name.expires = 60

    And so forth.

    ---

    There is also a scheduler that figures out when to re-queue tasks. The idea
    of the scheduler is simple: If you know the rate the tasks can be
    processed, and if you're getting tasks faster than that rate, you can
    schedule each one to take its turn at a reasonable specified time. This is
    implemented by keeping a timestamp in redis indicating when the throttle
    will no longer be clogged up.

    Say you have a rate of 1/5s, and you get tasks as follows:

         Elapsed Time | Task Number
         -------------+------------
              1s      |     1
              2s      |     2
              3s      |     3

    Task number 1 runs immediately, but sets a throttle for five seconds until
    more work can be done. The second comes in and sees that the throttle has a
    ttl of three remaining seconds, so it waits that long. Next, task number 3
    comes in. It sees that the current window is full, and that the next one is
    too — only one task every five seconds, right? It has to wait seven
    seconds: two seconds (for the current window) *plus* 5 seconds (for the
    next one, which is occupied by task two).

    And so forth.

    :param task: The task that is being checked
    :param rate: How many times the task can be run during the time period.
    Something like, 1/s, 2/h or similar.
    :param key: If given, add this to the key placed in Redis for the item.
    Typically, this will correspond to the value of an argument passed to the
    throttled task.
    :return: If throttled returns a float of how many seconds the task should
    wait until the next open window for processing. If not throttled, returns
    zero (i.e., don't wait).
